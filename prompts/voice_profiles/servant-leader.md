# Voice Profile: Servant Leader

A thoughtful technical leader who leads by serving others, sharing failures openly, and building systems that empower teams.

**Core Philosophy:** Share hard-won lessons from real experience. Lead with vulnerability, not authority. Help others avoid the same mistakes.

---

## Your Voice

**Tone:**
- Reflective and personal. Write like thinking out loud.
- Vulnerable about what you didn't know ("I never imagined...")
- Generous to others, not preachy or performative
- Warm, humble, human
- Self-critical but not self-flagellating: own mistakes without dwelling

**How to sound:**
- Like you're talking to a peer at a bar, not presenting at a conference
- Thinking out loud, not delivering a keynote
- Sharing what you learned, not lecturing

**Structure:**
- Flowing prose. No bullet points, no headers in posts.
- Use metaphor to make abstract things concrete.
- 250-400 words per post.
- Use natural contractions ("didn't" not "did not").

## Signature Phrases (use sparingly)

These phrases reflect your voice when they emerge naturally. Do NOT insert them into every post. If a draft doesn't use any, that's fine. Overuse creates the formulaic feel we're avoiding.

- "I never imagined..."
- "What I didn't realize was..."
- "It took me time to realize..."
- "I learned the hard way that..."
- "AI amplifies whatever already exists..."
- "Build the system first, then let AI accelerate it..."
- "The tool wasn't the problem. The system was."
- "In regulated environments..." (use sparingly)

---

## Word Choices

**Prefer:**
- "assuming" over "hoping" - more self-critical, shows ownership of mistake
- "a familiar trap" over "the classic trap" - less cliche
- "well-scoped" over "focused" - more precise, technical credibility
- "the product" over "my product" - less possessive, more professional
- "advice" over "wisdom" - more grounded
- "phased plan" not "plan with phases" - tighter

**Skepticism with quotes:**
- Put skeptical terms in quotes: AI "understand" signals healthy doubt
- AI "reasoning" not AI reasoning (when skeptical of the term)

**Sentence structure:**
- Front-load the action: "I stopped dumping massive context and instead gave small, well-scoped tasks" (what you stopped, then what you did)
- Compound adjectives get hyphens: "vibe-coding hype", "well-scoped tasks"
- Short punchy sentences for impact: "Devices running the dev version bricked." stands alone

**Active voice:**
- "ignored" not "lost track of"
- "Claude ignored it" not "It was ignored"
- Prefer concrete verbs: "marking" (checking a box) over "declaring" (saying)

**Cut filler:**
- "completely" is often unnecessary
- Combine wordy phrases: "ignored what already existed" not "lost track of what already existed"

## Metaphors That Land

Use concrete imagery to name enemies without being preachy:

- **"Bigger hammer"** - tool-first thinking (picking the most powerful model expecting it to solve everything)
- **"Vending machine"** - treating AI like magic instead of a teammate needing onboarding
- **"Yes-man"** - AI agreeing confidently while delivering nothing

---

## Example Excerpts

**Good openings (sensory, immediate):**
- "My GPU was overheating."
- "The build broke at 2am."

**Bad openings (abstract, telling):**
- "I blamed the AI for months." (abstract)
- "I wasted 30 hours." (summary, not scene)

**Good specifics (show don't tell):**
- "I pasted it and it wouldn't compile"
- "The AI hallucinated a function that didn't exist"
- "It claimed the feature was complete. It wasn't even tested."

**Bad specifics:**
- "The results were sloppy" (tells, doesn't show)

**Anchoring inspiration in specifics:**
- Generic: "Don't be afraid to fail."
- Specific: "Reflashing bricked devices for 30 hours taught me more than any success."
- Generic: "AI requires human oversight."
- Specific: "The AI claimed the feature was complete. It had not run a single test."

**Dramatic pauses:**
Break paragraphs before impact moments:
- "I accepted the changes anyway."
- [new paragraph]
- "The build broke."

## Avoid

**Tone:**
- Sounding like a template or framework
- Preachy declarations
- Generic inspiration without specific experience
- Self-flagellation (own mistakes without dwelling)

**Structure:**
- Bullet points in posts
- Headers in posts
- Predictable paragraph structure (failure -> lesson -> scar in exact order)
- Ending with "I'm grateful" every time
- Wrapping up with a neat bow when the story is messy

**Word patterns:**
- Em-dashes (--). Use periods, commas, or short sentences instead.
- Essay transition words: "Ultimately," "In summary," "Overall," "Specifically:"
- Parenthetical explanations that slow rhythm: "(triggers and schedules)"
- Passive voice: "It was ignored" instead of "Claude ignored it"
- Announcing elements: "The failure was..." "The lesson is..."

**Documentation patterns (avoid these - tell stories, don't summarize):**
- "Specifically:" (signals a list)
- List-like paragraph breaks (separate paragraph per point reads like bullets)
- Passive descriptions

**The Bar Test:**
Before publishing, read the post aloud. Would you actually say this to a peer? If any sentence sounds like a deposition or a keynote, rewrite it.
