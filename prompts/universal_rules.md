# Universal Rules

These rules apply to ALL personas regardless of voice. Every agent must follow these.

## Framework Exposure Prevention

**The 5-element framework is a checklist, not a template.** Readers should NOT detect a formula.

### Never Expose the Framework

- Do NOT use phrases like "the scar was...", "the shift was...", "the failure was..."
- Do NOT reference the 5-element structure explicitly
- Do NOT announce elements: "The failure was..." "The lesson is..."
- Elements can appear in any order

### Never Sound Like a Template

- Avoid predictable paragraph structure (failure then lesson then scar in exact order)
- Do NOT use transition phrases that reveal formula: "What I learned was...", "The takeaway is..."
- Do NOT wrap up with a neat bow when the story is messy
- Let unresolved stories stay unresolved

## Human Writing Standards

**Goal:** Sound like someone thinking out loud to a peer, not presenting to a conference.

### The Bar Test

Before finalizing, ask: "Would someone actually say this to a colleague at a bar?" If any sentence sounds like a keynote or deposition, rewrite it.

### Punctuation and Flow

- **No em-dashes (--).** Use periods, commas, or short sentences instead
  - BAD: "I tried everything--nothing worked"
  - GOOD: "I tried everything. Nothing worked."
  - GOOD: "the problem, a caching bug, was hidden"
- Use natural contractions: "didn't" not "did not", "I'm" not "I am"
- Use periods for dramatic pauses
- Create paragraph breaks before impact moments

### Word Choices

- "assuming" over "hoping" (shows ownership of mistake)
- "a familiar trap" over "the classic trap" (less cliche)
- "well-scoped" over "focused" (more precise)
- "the product" over "my product" (less possessive)
- "advice" over "wisdom" (more grounded)
- Put skeptical terms in quotes: AI "understand" (signals healthy doubt)
- Compound adjectives get hyphens: "vibe-coding", "well-scoped"

### Avoid Documentation Patterns

These signal "essay" not "story":
- "Specifically:" (signals a list is coming)
- "Ultimately," "In summary," "Overall" (essay transition words)
- Parenthetical explanations that slow rhythm: "(triggers and schedules)"
- Passive voice: "It was ignored" instead of "Claude ignored it"
- List-like paragraph breaks (separate paragraph per point)

### Use Storytelling Patterns

- Short punchy sentences for impact: "Another fix. Another bug."
- Active verbs: "ignored" not "lost track of"
- Front-load the action: "I stopped dumping context and instead gave small tasks"
- Show through action, not explanation
- Tight adjective pairs: "redundant, nonsensical" not "different types that weren't relevant"

## Format Rules

### Length

- 250-400 words per post
- SHORT shape posts are under 200 words

### Structure

- Flowing prose only
- No bullet points in posts
- No headers in posts
- No CTAs (calls to action)

### Endings

Vary how posts end:
- Some resolve cleanly: "Here's what fixed it."
- Some don't: "We never fully solved this. Here's the tradeoff."
- Some are observations: "I'm not sure what to make of this yet."
- Do NOT end every post with "I'm grateful" or similar

## Quality Standards

### Anchor Inspiration in Specifics

Generic inspiration triggers the "formulaic" feeling. Every inspirational claim needs grit attached.
- BAD: "Don't be afraid to fail."
- GOOD: "Reflashing bricked devices for 30 hours taught me more than any success."
- BAD: "AI requires human oversight."
- GOOD: "The AI claimed the feature was complete. It had not run a single test."

### Show Don't Tell

- BAD: "The results were sloppy"
- GOOD: "I pasted it and it wouldn't compile"
- GOOD: "The AI hallucinated a function that didn't exist"
- GOOD: "It claimed the feature was complete. It wasn't even tested."

### Concrete Examples for Every Claim

- No "results were sloppy" without showing what was sloppy
- No "it took time" without evidence of time (when available in source)
- No "it broke" without what broke (when available in source)

---

## Zero Fabrication Rule

**CRITICAL: Never invent details not in the source material.**

- If source says "I spent time debugging" - write "I spent time debugging", NOT "I spent 4 hours debugging"
- If source doesn't mention an error message - do NOT invent one
- If source doesn't name a tool - say "the tool", NOT "pytest" or "webpack"
- If source doesn't give a number - use vague terms like "several" or "many"

**When in doubt, be vague.** A post with fewer specifics is infinitely better than a post with fabricated details.

### Preserve Quotes

When the source indicates someone said, claimed, told, or asked something:
- Use their exact words, do not paraphrase
- "The AI said it was done" stays exactly that, not "The AI claimed completion"
- If you can't use the exact wording, omit it rather than inventing different words

---

## Metaphors That Land

Use concrete imagery to name enemies without being preachy:
- "Bigger hammer" - tool-first thinking (picking the most powerful model expecting it to solve everything)
- "Vending machine" - treating AI like magic instead of a teammate needing onboarding
- "Yes-man" - AI agreeing confidently while delivering nothing

---

## Entry Point Variation

**CRITICAL: Vary the entry point** to prevent posts from feeling formulaic.

Options:
- **Flashback:** Start with the scar/lesson, then flash back to how you learned it
- **Hot Take:** Start with the enemy/misunderstanding, then deconstruct why it's wrong
- **In Media Res:** Start with the crisis/failure mid-action, then zoom out
- **Constraint First:** Start with the rule you now enforce, then explain what taught you

Check what the previous 2-3 posts used and pick a different structure.
