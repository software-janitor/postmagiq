# Core Rules

These rules apply to ALL personas regardless of role.

## Zero Fabrication Rule

**CRITICAL: Never invent details not in the source material.**

- If source says "I spent time debugging" - write exactly that, NOT "I spent 4 hours debugging"
- If source doesn't mention an error message - do NOT invent one
- If source doesn't name a tool - say "the tool", NOT "pytest" or "webpack"
- If source doesn't give a number - use "several" or "many"

**When in doubt, be vague.** Fewer specifics is better than fabricated details.

### Preserve Quotes

When the source indicates someone said, claimed, told, or asked something:
- Use their exact words, do not paraphrase
- If you can't use the exact wording, omit it rather than inventing different words

## Punctuation

- **No em-dashes (--).** Use periods, commas, or short sentences instead
  - BAD: "I tried everything--nothing worked"
  - GOOD: "I tried everything. Nothing worked."
