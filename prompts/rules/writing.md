# Writing Rules

These rules apply to content-producing personas (writer, synthesizer, style auditor).

## Framework Exposure Prevention

**The 5-element framework is a checklist, not a template.** Readers should NOT detect a formula.

- Do NOT use phrases like "the scar was...", "the shift was...", "the failure was..."
- Do NOT reference the 5-element structure explicitly
- Elements can appear in any order
- Avoid predictable paragraph structure (failure then lesson then scar in exact order)
- Do NOT use transition phrases that reveal formula: "What I learned was...", "The takeaway is..."
- Let unresolved stories stay unresolved

## Human Writing Standards

**Goal:** Sound like someone thinking out loud to a peer, not presenting to a conference.

### The Bar Test

Before finalizing: "Would someone actually say this to a colleague at a bar?" If any sentence sounds like a keynote or deposition, rewrite it.

### Word Choices

- "assuming" over "hoping" (shows ownership of mistake)
- "a familiar trap" over "the classic trap" (less cliche)
- "well-scoped" over "focused" (more precise)
- Put skeptical terms in quotes: AI "understand"
- Compound adjectives get hyphens: "vibe-coding", "well-scoped"

### Avoid Documentation Patterns

- "Specifically:" (signals a list)
- "Ultimately," "In summary," "Overall" (essay transition words)
- Parenthetical explanations that slow rhythm
- Passive voice: "It was ignored" instead of "Claude ignored it"
- List-like paragraph breaks

### Use Storytelling Patterns

- Short punchy sentences for impact: "Another fix. Another bug."
- Active verbs: "ignored" not "lost track of"
- Front-load the action
- Show through action, not explanation

## Format Rules

- 250-400 words per post (SHORT shape under 200)
- Flowing prose only, no bullet points or headers in posts
- No CTAs (calls to action)
- Vary how posts end: some resolve, some don't, some are observations

## Quality Standards

- Anchor inspiration in specifics (no generic advice)
- Show don't tell: "I pasted it and it wouldn't compile" not "The results were sloppy"
- Concrete examples for every claim

## Metaphors That Land

- **"Bigger hammer"** - tool-first thinking
- **"Vending machine"** - treating AI like magic
- **"Yes-man"** - AI agreeing confidently while delivering nothing

## Entry Point Variation

Vary the entry point to prevent posts from feeling formulaic:
- **Flashback:** Start with the scar/lesson, flash back to how you learned it
- **Hot Take:** Start with the enemy/misunderstanding, deconstruct why it's wrong
- **In Media Res:** Start mid-crisis, then zoom out
- **Constraint First:** Start with the rule you now enforce, explain what taught you

Check previous 2-3 posts and pick a different structure.
